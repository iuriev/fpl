# FPL Points Prediction

Expected FPL points a player will score in a gameweek.
This is the top-level prediction output. It aggregates all sub-models into a single `xPts` figure.

Sub-models consumed (all values must come from these specs — never recomputed inline):
- `team-xg-prediction.md` → `λ_for`, `λ_against`
- `team-cleansheet-prediction.md` → `csProb`
- `xa-prediction.md` → `xAssists`
- `shared.md` → `minsProb`, `prob60Plus`, `confidence`, `blendedXgPer90`

## Outputs

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `xGoals` | `number` | Expected goals scored by this player |
| `xAssists` | `number` | Expected assists (from `xa-prediction.md`) |
| `csProb` | `number \| null` | Clean sheet probability (from `team-cleansheet-prediction.md`) |
| `defconPts` | `number` | Expected defensive contribution bonus points |
| `modelXPts` | `number` | Pure model expected points before EP blend |
| `xPts` | `number` | Final headline expected points (hybrid model + EP) |
| `confidence` | `'low' \| 'medium' \| 'high'` | Data quality signal (from `shared.md`) |
| `epNextAnchor` | `number` | FPL's `ep_next` used as the EP blend anchor |

For double gameweeks, `xGoals`, `xAssists`, `defconPts`, `modelXPts`, `xPts`, and
`epNextAnchor` are **summed** across fixtures. `csProb` is combined with the DGW formula
from `team-cleansheet-prediction.md`.

---

## Step 1 — Player xG

```
xGoals = blendedXgPer90 × fixtureAttackMultiplier × minsProb

fixtureAttackMultiplier = λ_for / exp(μ)   // league-average baseline = exp(μ)
                        = 1                 // when λ_for is unknown (slug unresolved)
```

`blendedXgPer90` is the player's rolling xG/90 blended with a role/position prior (see `shared.md`).
`λ_for` and `μ` come from `team-xg-prediction.md` — never recomputed here.

**Why not `λ_for × shareXg`?**
The previous formula multiplied the Poisson goals-based `λ_for` by `shareXg` derived from
Opta-scale FPL xG data. These operate on different scales (Opta xG > actual goals), producing
systematically deflated values (max ~0.5 for top strikers instead of ~0.7–1.0+).
The new formula uses the player's direct xG/90 rate from FPL history as the baseline,
and the Poisson model only for the per-fixture opponent difficulty adjustment.

---

## Step 2 — Player xA

`xAssists` is taken directly from `xa-prediction.md`. It is not recomputed in this model.

---

## Step 3a — Defcon points

Defcon = FPL's "defensive contribution" bonus (tackles + interceptions reaching threshold).

### Hit rate

```
DEFCON_THRESHOLD = { DEF: 10, MID: 12, FWD: 12 }   // defensive_contribution score
PRIOR_HIT_RATE   = { DEF: 0.38, MID: 0.28, FWD: 0.06, GK: 0 }
WINDOW = 8 GW rows where minutes ≥ 60

played = history rows where minutes ≥ 60, last WINDOW rows
hits   = played rows where defensiveContribution ≥ THRESHOLD[position]

// Bayesian blend with prior weight = 3
defconHitRate = (hits + PRIOR_HIT_RATE[position] × 3) / (played.length + 3)
```

If `played.length === 0`, `defconHitRate = PRIOR_HIT_RATE[position]`.
GK always returns `0` for both hit rate and defcon points.

### Expected defcon points

```
DEFCON_PTS = 2

defconPts = DEFCON_PTS × defconHitRate × minsProb
```

---

## Step 3b — Bonus points

FPL bonus points (1–3 pts) are awarded via the BPS system to the top 3 scorers per match.
Expected bonus is modelled as a 50/50 blend of a context-based estimate and a player-level
rolling average. GK uses rolling average only (context formula would double-count CS/saves).

### Position-level prior

```
BONUS_PRIOR = { FWD: 0.39, MID: 0.16, DEF: 0.12, GK: 0.16 }
```
Calibrated from 2024-25 EPL season (N ≈ 11 000 player-game rows, minutes > 0).

### Player rolling average

```
BONUS_WINDOW = 10 appearances (minutes > 0)
BONUS_FULL_WEIGHT_GAMES = 8

rollingBonusAvg = mean(bonus) over last BONUS_WINDOW played games
weight = min(games / BONUS_FULL_WEIGHT_GAMES, 1)
blendedBonusRate = weight × rollingBonusAvg + (1 − weight) × BONUS_PRIOR[position]
```

### Context-based estimate (non-GK)

Uses Poisson(λ_gi) where `λ_gi = xGoals + xAssists`, weighted by empirical bonus rates:

```
BONUS_RATE_BY_GI = [0.042, 0.860, 2.224, 2.690]  // indexed by g+a bucket: 0, 1, 2, 3+

p0      = e^(−λ_gi)
p1      = λ_gi × e^(−λ_gi)
p2      = (λ_gi² / 2) × e^(−λ_gi)
p3plus  = 1 − p0 − p1 − p2

contextBonus = p0×0.042 + p1×0.860 + p2×2.224 + p3plus×2.690
```

### Final bonus pts

```
// Non-GK:
bonusPts = (0.5 × contextBonus + 0.5 × blendedBonusRate) × minsProb

// GK:
bonusPts = blendedBonusRate × minsProb
```

---

## Step 3c — GK saves points

GK earns 1 pt per 3 saves. Only applies when `position = GK`.

```
SAVES_WINDOW = 8 played appearances
SAVES_PRIOR_PER90 = 3.0

avgSaves = mean(saves) over last SAVES_WINDOW played games
         // fallback to SAVES_PRIOR_PER90 if no history

savesPts = (avgSaves / 3) × minsProb
```

For non-GK positions, `savesPts = 0`.

---

## Step 3d — Yellow card deduction

FPL deducts 1 pt per yellow card.

```
YELLOW_PRIOR = { FWD: 0.08, MID: 0.10, DEF: 0.12, GK: 0.02 }
YC_WINDOW = 10 played appearances
YC_FULL_WEIGHT_GAMES = 8

ycRate = mean(yellowCards) over last YC_WINDOW played games
weight = min(games / YC_FULL_WEIGHT_GAMES, 1)
blendedYcRate = weight × ycRate + (1 − weight) × YELLOW_PRIOR[position]

yellowDeduction = blendedYcRate × minsProb × (−1)
```

---

## Step 4 — modelXPts

FPL scoring rules translated into expected value:

```
POS_GOAL_PTS = { GK: 6, DEF: 6, MID: 5, FWD: 4 }
POS_CS_PTS   = { GK: 4, DEF: 4, MID: 1, FWD: 0 }

appearance = (1 − prob60Plus) × 1 + prob60Plus × 2
             // 1 pt for playing any minutes, +1 pt for playing 60+
             // Uses prob60Plus (not minsProb) — see shared.md

goals   = xGoals × POS_GOAL_PTS[position]
assists = xAssists × 3

cs = (position ∈ {GK, DEF, MID}) ? csProb × minsProb × POS_CS_PTS[position] : 0
     // csProb is set for GK, DEF, and MID (MID earns 1 pt for CS)
     // csProb already contains one minsProb factor (see team-cleansheet-prediction.md),
     // so the minsProb × csProb product effectively gives: csProbTeam × minsProb²
     // This is intentional — both conditions (playing 60+ AND team keeping CS) must hold.

gc = (position ∈ {GK, DEF}) ? floor(λ_against × minsProb / 2) × (−1) : 0
     // −1 pt per 2 goals conceded while on pitch (integer penalty)

modelXPts = appearance + goals + assists + cs + gc
          + defconPts + bonusPts + savesPts + yellowDeduction
```

---

## Step 5 — Hybrid xPts

The final `xPts` blends the pure model output with FPL's official `ep_next` to anchor
sparse-data players to a reasonable baseline.

```
EP_WEIGHT = { high: 0.25, medium: 0.45, low: 0.65 }

xPts = (1 − EP_WEIGHT[confidence]) × modelXPts + EP_WEIGHT[confidence] × epNext
```

`epNext` = `ep_next` from FPL bootstrap-static for the target event. Element-summary
history rows do not carry per-GW expected points (`xp` is 0 in cache); when the target
event is already cached, `loadCurrentSeasonFacts` overwrites `xp` on target-event rows
from bootstrap `ep_next` before scoring.
`confidence` is computed from `shared.md`.

| Confidence | Model weight | EP weight | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| `high` | 75% | 25% | Enough history — trust the model |
| `medium` | 55% | 45% | Mixed signal |
| `low` | 35% | 65% | Sparse history — anchor to FPL EP |

## Constraints

- `xAssists` and `csProb` are **always** taken from their own prediction specs.
  They are never recalculated inline with different formulas.
- `λ_for` and `λ_against` are always resolved from the **same** `TeamPoissonFit` run —
  not from separate fits for different sub-models.
- `csProb` is set for GK, DEF, and MID. FWD always receives `csProb = null`.
- `savesPts` is non-zero only for GK.
- `modelXPts` is stored in `pred_player_gw.model_x_pts` independently of `xPts`,
  so the EP blend can be audited or changed without re-running the full scoring pipeline.
